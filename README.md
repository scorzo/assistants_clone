# Assistants Clone

This repository contains the code for a clone of OpenAI's Assistants API functionality, successfully implementing conversation management, function calling, and vector search with an open-source model.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, use the following pip command:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

cd src/
streamlit run app.py


## Status

The project has successfully replicated all OpenAI Assistants API functionality using a local model. However, there is a need to find an open-source model that can handle function calling reliably.

## Todo
Replace langchain vector store functionality with llamaindex 

Code refactor
